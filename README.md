# Charlex WebOS

A fun web-based operating system simulation built with **Vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks, no Java!). I'm a Googler who loves JavaScript for its simplicity and power in the browser.

## Quick Start

1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser (Chrome works best).
3. Enjoy your mini OS!

## What You Can Do

- **Drag windows** around the desktop.
- **Click dock icons** to open apps like Notes, CPU Monitor, Shell, etc.
- **Take encrypted notes** and save/load them.
- **Simulate a Linux shell** with basic commands.
- **Toggle between macOS and Windows styles**.
- **Power controls** (reboot, halt - simulated).
- **File explorer** for your encrypted files.

## Tech Stuff

- **Backendless System**: Runs entirely in the browser - no server, no backend, no dependencies!
- Pure JavaScript (Vanilla JS all the way!)
- CSS for styling
- Uses modern web APIs for encryption and storage

## Why Vanilla JS?

Because JavaScript is awesome! No complex setups, just open the HTML file and you're good to go. Perfect for learning and experimenting.
